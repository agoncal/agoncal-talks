== Asynchronous event example

----
public class FirstBean {
    @Inject [highlight]#Event<Post># postEvent;

    public void saveNewPost(Post myPost) {
        postEvent.[highlight]*fireAsync(myPost)*; //<1>
    }
}

public class SecondBean {
    public void listenPost([highlight]*@ObservesAsync* Post post) { //<2>
        System.out.println("Received : " + evt.message());
    }
}
----
<1> We introduced a `fireAsync()` method
<2> For backward compatibility we had to add an `@ObservesAsync` observer

== Let's test asynchronous event

TIP: Weld 3 Alpha (preview of CDI 2.0 RI) is available

TIP: WildFly includes a patch mechanism to upgrade implementations

TIP: We can patch WildFly with a simple command
